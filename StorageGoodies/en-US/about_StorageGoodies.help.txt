SHORT DESCRIPTION
    The StorageGoodies module provides functions for managing VMware datastores
    and SCSI LUNs

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The StorageGoodies module was written to provide functions for managing
    VMware datastores and SCSI LUNs.  The module leverages some of the VMware
    PowerCLI cmdlets, and requires that PowerCLI is installed on the Windows
    machine on which the StorageGoodies module shall be used.

    When connected to a vCenter, and using this module, one can mount and
    dismount VMFS datastores on VMHosts, attach and detach SCSI LUNs from
    VMHosts, and the datastore/LUN status information for the desired objects.

QUICK START
    Import the VMware PowerCLI module, then import the StorageGoodies module.
    Get the commands in this module with the Get-Command cmdlet like:
        Get-Command -Module StorageGoodies
    Then, go to it by getting mount information, and mounting and dismounting
    as desired!
